<h1>Goals? I think that's what they are called</h1>

    Goals? I've heard about these mysterious things. Apparently, they're like imaginary 
    finish lines we set for ourselves in the race of life. But who needs a finish line 
    when you're having fun just running around in circles?

<h2>The Accidental Goal-Setter</h2>
<p>
    The other day, I accidentally set a goal. I decided I wanted to learn how to play 
    "Stairway to Heaven" on a kazoo. Don't ask me why - it just seemed like a good idea 
    at the time. Now I'm knee-deep in kazoos and sheet music, wondering if I've bitten 
    off more than I can chew (or hum, in this case).

<h2>The Non-Goal of Writing This Article</h2>
<p>
    Ironically, writing this article about goals was never actually a goal of mine. 
    It just sort of happened, like most things in my life. One minute I'm contemplating 
    the meaning of life, and the next I'm typing away about goals. Life's funny like that.

<h2>Conclusion: To Goal or Not to Goal?</h2>
<p>
    So, are goals worth it? Who knows! Maybe the real goals are the friends we made along 
    the way. Or maybe they're just a clever ploy by calendar companies to sell more 
    planners. Either way, I'm off to practice my kazoo. Wish me luck!
